# Intuitive Citations

## Statement

You have submitted your first paper for review, unfortunately it has been rejected. But the only critique is that you have not followed the citation guidelines. Instead of listing all authors you are required by the journal to just list the first surname alphabetically and add a \t{"et al."}. You have hundreds of citations, so you decide to automate this process. Write a program which takes all the authors of a work and prints the first surname when ordered alphabetically and adds \t{"et al."}.

## Input format

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 <= n <= 50$), the number of authors.
Then $n$ lines follow, each with 2 strings, the first name and last name of each author. Both will only consist of letters of the English alphabet, all letters will be lowercase, except for the first letter, which will be uppercase. Both strings will have between 2 and 20 characters (inclusive).

## Output format

Print the first surname in alphabetical order and add \t{" et al."}
