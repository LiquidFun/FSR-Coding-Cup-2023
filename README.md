# This is a collection of my own competitive problems

Problems which have been used will be prepended with a tilde (`~`) and will occur here.

## Creating a problem

## List of possible problem statements


1. ~~Gloves are too thick for the bicycle lock. Can only turn 2 dials at once, 2-100 numbers from 0 to 9 on lock. How many steps to turn to correct solution (if possible) given start position and correct position.~~

2. ~~You are in Rostock, but tomorrow you want to be at home! So you decide to go with deutsche bahn, however you see that their planning system is not working. So you take the matters in your own hands. You take all routes in the system and create your own timetable and routing. Of course the deutsche bahn trains may have some delay. Given the routes for the day and the maximum delay for each train, print the earliest possible time for arrival, and the latest possible time~~

3. While again not paying attention in the lecture, you are playing wordle on your phone. You see that you only have 4 guesses left. You wonder what is the best way to test as many letters as possible. Given a list of 5-letter words (may not be valid wordle words), find 4 words which maximize the number of distinct letters across them.

4. You just completed the lecture on how to create compilers, and now that you are an expert at it you want to test your skills. You decide to create your own programming language. First steps first, however, so you decide the most important thing is brackets, and lots of them. You want to write a parser which tells you whether a list of open and closed brackets is valid. Print "valid" or "invalid"

5. You wonder around the library looking for the best book on visual basic, but you see so many books that any book title you read starts to lose its meaning. You just see letters, and you start to wonder. Do these books on this shelf contain each letter of the english alphabet at least once? Print "yes" or "no"

6. You are a crazy good competitive programmer, you have read all 8 problems, you have 3 hours and 50 minutes of the contest remaining, and now you know how long each problem will take you in minutes. Print how many problems you will be able to solve in 3:50 and what the time penalty will be for those solved problems.

7. Tomorrow is the last submission day for your seminar paper, you have written exactly 0 words so far. It is time to work you say, it will be a long day. You prepare your custom self-built coffee machine for the next t hours. You have enough coffee for x coffee cups in that time. Each time it brews a coffee you drink it immediately and you gain a boost to your productivity for m minutes. Drinking multiple coffee cups in the same time is not as effective, it follows the formula sqrt(x), where x is the number of boosts active during that timeframe. Each minute you write n words, what is the maximum number of words you can write if you optimize the coffee machine?

8. You have decided to redesign the keyboard. Given a list of words, create an optimal keyboard on a integer grid, such that the distances between letters is minimized when typing the given words.

9. Construct a n x n grid of letters.  You are given m words, each word should occur exactly once in that grid either horizontally or vertically. "Easier" alternative: 1x26 row of numbers, still really hard, no idea how to solve?
