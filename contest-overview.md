# FSR Coding Cup

![](POSTER)

## Who? What? Why? When? Where?

* **Who?** Everyone who is a student in **any** semester in **any** course of study can participate in **teams** of **1** to **3** people. Each team only has **a single** computer though. Basic programming skills are enough to solve multiple problems! Everyone is welcome!

* **What?** A programming competition where you code a solution to **12** problems in **4** hours, submit it online in a judge system, and get immediate feedback whether the solution was correct.

* **Why?** Participate in order to solve interesting problems, have fun with friends, test your programming skills and win some small monetary **prizes** and **t-shirts** (and eat **pizza** of course).

* **When?** **Saturday, 07.01.2023** from **14:00** to **21:00**, see *Schedule*. The contest itself will be from **15:00** to **19:00**.

* **Where?** 
    * On-site: **Konrad-Zuse-Haus** (institute of computer science) **Albert-Einstein-Stra√üe 22, 18059** Room **301**.
    * Online (ineligible for prizes): TODO url

## "Really? But I'm just a newbie programmer?"

Everyone who can code at least a little bit is able to participate. There will be 12 problems to solve, some of them will be easy enough that anyone with any coding experience can solve them. To encourage this there will be a price for first-year students (erstis). In fact, internet access is allowed during this contest, so if you are a beginner you don't have to know any programming language by memory (communicating with other teams or asking for solutions is strongly disallowed though, see below for exact rules).

Also, many problems are not simply "coding" problems, often you have to have the right insight and idea, therefore even non-computer-scientists have good chances of winning!

But of course the hardest problem will be even a tough nut to crack for even the best programmers. So if you are someone who dreams in code you can be sure that you will find something interesting for you. In short, there will be something for everyone!

## Contest format

This section gives an overview of the contest and how it works, for the full rules see the *rules* section below.

### Problems

The contest will go for **4** hours and will have **12** problems. The problems will **not** be sorted according to difficulty, it is part of the competition to figure out which problems are easy, it **will** be possible to view which other teams have solved which problems though.

The problems are usually little riddles which have multiple solutions. For example, a problem might be: *given a list of numbers, find which 2 numbers add up to some sum x?*. Your first idea might be to just check every pair, but what if there are 1 million numbers? Then you would have to check 1 trillion pairs! This will take way too long, so what else is there? Well, you could check for every number *a* if the number *x-a* is contained in the set of numbers. This will be much faster!

TODO: Eventuell zu kompliziertes beispiel?

For every problem there will be a description, a sample input and sample output. You are to write a solution which accepts input on `stdin` and prints on `stdout`. Once you have made sure that the solution is correct on the examples, you can submit it to a judge system, this judge will then evaluate your solution on about 100 hidden test-cases. If your solution is correct for all of them it will count as solved.

The teams are ranked by number of solved problems, then by the cumulative sum of submission times (see the rules for a complete description).


### Programming languages

The following programming languages may be used: **C, C++, C#, D, Go, OCaml, Delphi, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, Python, Scala, Rust, Ruby, JavaScript**.

It is guaranteed that all problems are solvable with Python.

It is recommended to use the language you are most comfortable with. If you are not sure, Python or C++ is a great choice.

### Teams


Each team may have between **1** to **3** students, however each team will only have access to **a single** computer. This format is heavily inspired by the ACM-ICPC type of programming contests. Having multiple people on the team allows you to:

* Code together, it may be easier to spot mistakes
* Have more fun, sometimes even not getting the right answer is more fun together
* Bounce ideas on each other, sometimes everyone is stuck

However, sometimes multiple teammates may only distract you. Everyone can decide for themselves what is more fun to them and we believe that any team whether of size 1 or 3 has equal chances to win. Therefore all teams will be evaluated in the same leaderboard. 

If you are looking for a teammate, but do not know anyone who wants to participate please reach out to $EMAIL (TODO).

## My motivation

This contest is not a one-off, in fact there is a huge community of competitive programmers. The ACM-ICPC competitions are yearly competitions where 60000 students participate annually. The finals are notoriously hard to get to, so there are regionals, for example there is the NWERC (north western europe) and GCPC (germany-only) contests. These competitions are a big deal for many people, including me. I have been participating in such contests for many years and have also participated in the NWERC for the last 3 years. 

Unfortunately, despite Uni-Rostock winning the NWERC in 2014(TODO) there has been barely any activity here for this type of contests since. This contest is a opportunity to gauge interest in such things and to possibly spark a new team of active people who want to compete and who want to solve problems with the same joy as me.
