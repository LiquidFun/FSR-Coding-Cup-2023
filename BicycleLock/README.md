Your gloves are too thick for the bicycle lock. You can only turn 2 dials at once, 2-100 numbers from 0 to 9 on lock. How many steps to turn to correct solution (if possible) given start position and correct position.


Variation: instead of 2 dials at once, give m dials to turn.
Variation 2: instead of saying whether a given position is possible, give the number of possible positions for a given m and a given target position
